# ISC Earthquake toolbox for MATLAB
A set of MATLAB functions for downloading and handling earthquake data from the International Seismological Centre (ISC).

The toolbox contains a number of MATLAB livescripts to get you started. The first is an interactive script that allows you 
to search interactively the ISC database (via the ISC web site), and build a data bset based on the area, time span and magnitude 
range you are interested in.
