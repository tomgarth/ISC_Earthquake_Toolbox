# ISC Earthquake Toolbox for MATLAB
A set of MATLAB functions for downloading and handling earthquake data from the [International Seismological Centre (ISC)](http://www.isc.ac.uk/).
The toolbox contains a number of MATLAB livescripts to get you started. It requires [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Mapping Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/mapping.html?requestedDomain=).

A brief overview of the functionality is given in the MATLAB livescript **'Introduction_ISCToolboxForMATLAB.mlx'**.

More detailed examples are then given in 3 further livescripts detailed below.

- The first **(ISCtoolbox_WB1_Download_ISC_Data.mlx)** is a MATLAB livescript that allows you to interactively search the ISC 
database, and build a data bset based on the area, time span and magnitude range you are interested in.

- The second **(ISCtoolbox_WB2_Exploring_Earthquake_Locations.mlx)** gives an overview of the data that can be downloaded (either 
by you in the previous workbook, or one of the distributed example datasets) with a focus on plotting earthquake locations.

- The third **(ISCtoolbox_WB3_Exploring_Earthquake_Magnitudes.mlx)** introduces and compares different earthquake magnitude types, 
and enables a simpel interactive Mc and b-value calulations.
