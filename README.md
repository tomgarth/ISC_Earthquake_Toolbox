# ISC Earthquake toolbox for MATLAB
A set of MATLAB functions for downloading and handling earthquake data from the International Seismological Centre (ISC).
The toolbox contains a number of MATLAB livescripts to get you started. 

The first (ISCtoolbox_WB1_Download_ISC_Data.mlx) is an interactive script that allows you to search interactively the ISC 
database (via the ISC web site), and build a data bset based on the area, time span and magnitude range you are 
interested in.

The second (ISCtoolbox_WB2_Exploring_Earthquake_Locations.mlx) gives an overview of the data that can be downloaded (either 
by you in the previous workbook, or one of the distributed example datasets) with afoucs on plotting earthquake locations.

The third (ISCtoolbox_WB3_Exploring_Earthquake_Magnitudes.mlx) introduces and compares different earthquake magnitude types, 
and enables a simpel interactive Mc and b-value calulations.
