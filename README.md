# ISC Earthquake Toolbox for MATLAB
A set of MATLAB functions for downloading and handling earthquake data from the International Seismological Centre (ISC).
The toolbox contains a number of MATLAB livescripts to get you started. 

A brief overview of the functionality is given in the MATLAB livescript 'Introduction_ISCToolboxForMATLAB.mlx'. More detailed examples are then given in 3 further livescripts detailed below.

The first (ISCtoolbox_WB1_Download_ISC_Data.mlx) is a MATLAB livescript that allows you to interactively search the ISC 
database, and build a data bset based on the area, time span and magnitude range you are interested in.

The second (ISCtoolbox_WB2_Exploring_Earthquake_Locations.mlx) gives an overview of the data that can be downloaded (either 
by you in the previous workbook, or one of the distributed example datasets) with a focus on plotting earthquake locations.

The third (ISCtoolbox_WB3_Exploring_Earthquake_Magnitudes.mlx) introduces and compares different earthquake magnitude types, 
and enables a simpel interactive Mc and b-value calulations.
